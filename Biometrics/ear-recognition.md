## Overview

Ear recognition is an emerging biometric technology that uses the unique features of human ears for identification. Unlike face recognition, ears are less affected by aging and facial expressions.

### Why Ear Recognition?
- Ears have unique features that remain stable over time
- Less affected by facial expressions and aging
- Can work from side profiles
- Complementary to face recognition
